# Open Ocean :earth_africa:

The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value 

## About me

Banks serve as intermediaries between borrowers and lenders in today's world. Bank officials have the decision-making authority rather than the free market appetite. Loans were based on the borrowers caste, race, religion, and gender rather than their financial statement credibility.
There are a number of issues with centralised banking systems. Banks generally demand a higher safety mortgage when giving loans; this results in limited growth opportunities for small-scale companies that could otherwise thrive. Thus, Open Ocean offers a medium in which the borrower can receive loans only and only on the basis of their financial credibility.
